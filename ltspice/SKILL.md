name: ltspice-sim
description: Use when running LTspice circuit simulations through sim-cli — authoring `.net` netlists (and soon `.asc` schematics) for analog, power-electronics, and board-level designs, then reading structured `.meas` results from the log. Covers netlist authoring conventions, platform quirks (macOS 17.x vs Windows 26.x), and the sim-cli one-shot batch lifecycle.

not what the content says.

## What LTspice is (and isn't)

LTspice is the free SPICE3 simulator from Analog Devices. It has **no
vendor Python API** — unlike Fluent (pyfluent), COMSOL (mph), or MATLAB
(matlabengine). The sim-cli driver for LTspice is a thin adapter over
[**sim-ltspice**](https://github.com/svd-ai-lab/sim-ltspice), a
standalone Python library that IS the Python API for LTspice.

Implication: everything in this skill stays identical whether you call
`sim run foo.net --solver ltspice`, or import `sim_ltspice` directly in
Python. The file format understanding and platform quirks are the same.

## Input classification

| Input | Accepted by sim-cli? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `.net` / `.cir` / `.sp` netlist | ✅ today | SPICE3 syntax; first line is title (ignored by solver); must contain at least one analysis directive |
| `.asc` schematic (flat, library-local) | 🟡 sim-ltspice v0.1+ — on macOS goes through our native asc2net; on Windows/wine goes through LTspice's own `-netlist` | Schematic opens in LTspice GUI for human review |
| `.asc` schematic (hierarchical or custom lib) | 🟡 Windows / wine only | Routed through `sim_ltspice.schematic_to_netlist` (the in-process Python flattener, since LTspice 26.0.1's `-netlist` flag is broken). On macOS raises `MacOSCannotFlatten` with guidance to route via a Windows host. |
| `.raw` / `.log` inputs | ❌ outputs only | Do not pass these to `sim run` |

When you produce a netlist for an agent workflow, **always use `.net`**.
It's the most portable (no LTspice version drift) and the sim-cli
driver has the fewest edge cases for it.

## Platform capabilities

| Capability | macOS 17.x native | macOS 26.x native | Windows 26.x | Linux + wine |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `-b <netlist>` batch run | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `-Run -b` | ❌ (ignored) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `-ascii` raw output | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `-netlist <asc>` schematic→netlist | ❌ | ✅ † | ⚠️ broken on 26.0.1 | ✅ |
| `-ini <path>` reproducible-state run | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `-I<path>` symbol path injection | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `-FastAccess` `.raw` reformat | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `-sync` re-extract bundled libs | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `-version` print version (stderr) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `.asc` direct input to sim run | native asc2net only (flat + library-local) | native asc2net | full | full |
| `.log` encoding | UTF-16 LE (no BOM) | UTF-8 | UTF-8 | UTF-16 LE |
| `.raw` header encoding | UTF-16 LE | UTF-16 LE | UTF-16 LE | UTF-16 LE |

† On macOS 26 the `-netlist` flag works but `sim-ltspice`'s preferred
path is the in-process `schematic_to_netlist` flattener — no LTspice
binary touched. Use `-netlist` only when the flattener can't handle a
hierarchy or custom-symbol case.

If you need a feature macOS lacks (or to dodge the 26.0.1 `-netlist`
regression), route through `sim --host <windows-host>`. See
`../sim-cli/SKILL.md` for the HTTP dispatch model. The full
flag-by-flag table lives in
[`base/reference/command_line_switches.md`](base/reference/command_line_switches.md).

## Hard constraints (LTspice-specific)

These add to — do not replace — the shared skill's hard constraints.

1. **Every netlist must have an analysis directive.** At least one of
   `.tran`, `.ac`, `.dc`, `.op`, `.noise`, `.tf`, `.four`. Without one,
   LTspice returns exit code 0 but produces no useful output. `sim lint`
   catches this.
2. **Put `.meas` statements in the netlist, not in a config file.**
   That's how structured values get surfaced on `sim logs last --field
   measures`. Free-form `.print` output is harder to parse.
3. **Never rely on workspace / state across `sim run` calls.** Each
   invocation is a cold LTspice batch. Chain steps by writing out
   intermediate `.net` variations in Python, not by stateful execution.
4. **First line of a netlist is the title, always ignored.** Component
   declarations start at line 2. A common mistake is putting `V1 in 0
   1` on line 1 — LTspice silently treats it as comment text.
5. **Use single-letter element prefixes.** `R` / `C` / `L` / `V` / `I`
   / `D` / `Q` / `M` / `X`. Two-letter names like `R1a` are fine as
   *instance labels*, but the first letter must match the element
   kind.
6. **Ground is net `0` (numeric zero).** Not `GND`, not `0v`. Other
   names are arbitrary user-defined nets.

## Required protocol (one paragraph)

Follow the shared skill's required protocol for the **one-shot batch**
model. LTspice-specific steps: validate the `.net` has a title line +
at least one analysis directive + `.meas` statements for every metric
the acceptance criterion checks; run `sim run <script.net> --solver
ltspice`; read the structured results with `sim logs last --field
measures` (returns `{"<name>": {"expr": "...", "value": <float>,
"from": ..., "to": ...}}`); evaluate against acceptance per the shared
skill's `acceptance.md`. For parameter sweeps, use `.step param` inside
the netlist — one `sim run` covers the whole sweep; the resulting
`.raw` has one dataset per step.

## LTspice-specific layered content

Always read `base/reference/`, then the relevant snippets + workflows.

### `base/` — always relevant

### Documentation lookup

LTspice ships an extensive offline help set on Windows at
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\ADI\LTspice\LTspiceHelp\` (~738 HTML files
in 26.x — comprehensive SPICE + analysis reference). macOS 17 ships
no HTML help (in-GUI help only); macOS 26 has parity with Windows.

The community mirror at [ltwiki.org](https://ltwiki.org/) indexes the
same content and is searchable from any platform without LTspice
installed locally.

For authoritative syntax questions on a Windows host:

```bash
sim --host <windows-host> exec 'cat "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\ADI\LTspice\LTspiceHelp\<topic>.htm"'
```

For anyone else, consult the LTspice Users' Guide PDF (search
"LTspice Getting Started Guide" — Analog Devices publishes it openly).

## Common pitfalls (save yourself a cycle)

1. **Missing ground reference.** Every net that isn't declared somewhere
   must be connected to something — LTspice flags singular matrices
   cryptically. Always add ground (`FLAG 0` via the netlist is
   implicit when you reference net `0`).

2. **`.meas` misspelled as `.measure`.** Both work, but `.meas` is the
   shorter form used in every example and our parser is tuned for it.

3. **Windows `.log` encoding trap.** LTspice 26 writes UTF-8 logs;
   LTspice 17 (macOS) writes UTF-16 LE. `sim-ltspice` handles both
   transparently, but if you're reading the `.log` yourself with
   `open()`, sniff the encoding.

4. **Drive-letter paths in logs.** On Windows, the `.log` has a
   `Files loaded:\nC:\Users\...\design.net` block. A naive regex
   parser would see `C:` as a measure name. If you roll your own
   log parser, exclude newlines from the expression capture. (Ours
   does — see the sim-cli driver's regex.)

5. **macOS `.asc` refusal.** If `sim run my.asc --solver ltspice`
   errors with `MacOSCannotFlatten`, either (a) ensure the schematic
   uses only shipped-library symbols and no hierarchy, or (b) route
   via `sim --host <windows-host>`.

6. **`-netlist` is broken on LTspice 26.0.1 (Windows).** The flag
   silently hangs — no `.net` written, no exit code, no signal.
   Don't shell out to `LTspice.exe -netlist`; use
   `sim_ltspice.schematic_to_netlist` instead. See
   [`base/reference/command_line_switches.md`](base/reference/command_line_switches.md)
   for the full regression note.

7. **No GUI session log.** Unlike Flotherm, LTspice writes nothing
   for GUI events (popups, schematic-load failures, updater
   dialogs). The only file channel is the per-deck `<deck>.log`,
   which only covers solver-time errors. For hangs and GUI-only
   failures, the `sim_ltspice.runner` 300 s timeout is the
   triage primitive — see
   [`base/reference/log_channel_limits.md`](base/reference/log_channel_limits.md).

8. **Generic-model lookup is closed.** `Q1 c b e 2N9999` will fail
   at solve time unless `2N9999` is in `lib/cmp/standard.bjt` or
   pulled in via `.lib`/`.include`. The 8 `lib/cmp/standard.*`
   files are the closed enum — see
   [`base/reference/component_models.md`](base/reference/component_models.md)
   for offline lint via `ComponentModelCatalog`.
